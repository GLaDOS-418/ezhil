## Content type

You can specify content type with field `type` in your content. For example static pages can be set as type `page` which are excluded from recent posts and all posts page. You can use site params `mainSections` and `disableCommentsTypes` to control which page types are excluded from recent posts and Disqus comments respectively.

```md
---
title: "About"
date: 2019-04-19T21:37:58+05:30
type: "page"
---

This is some static page where you can write about yourself.
```

## Disable Comments

You can disable Disqus site wide if you don't set `DisqusShortname` param in config.

You can also disable all comments (disqus/giscus) from contents selectively or for all contents with certain content type. Use content field `comments` to disable Disqus from certain contents.

```md
---
title: "Content without comments"
date: 2019-04-19T21:37:58+05:30
comments: false
---

This is a content without comments.
```

You can also disable comments for certain content types by using site param `disableCommentsTypes`. You can check config section above for example.

## Social Media Sharing Buttons
check this repo for more information
https://github.com/Stals/hugo-share-buttons

## default `og:image` and `twitter:image` attributes for `<meta>` tags
If no `ogImage` or `twitterImage` tag is defined, the values fallback to the `featureImage` param from `config.toml`.

## Sample front-matter of a page
``` md
---
title: "page title"
description: "page description which also shows up as a short not on index page"
date: 2021-04-19T17:18:54+05:30
tags: [tag-1,tag-2]
ogImage: '/path/to/image/for/og_graph_image.jpg'
twitterImage: '/path/to/image/for/twitter_image.jpg'
draft: false
socialshare: true
---
```

## SVG diagrams using MermaidJS
draw SVG diagrams using [MermaidJS]( https://mermaid.js.org/). Theme used is *'forest'*.
You can draw as many diagram as possible.

Pan-and-Zoom of these diagrams is enabled via [bumbu/svg-pan-zoom]( https://github.com/bumbu/svg-pan-zoom ),
since these features are neither supported by Hugo nor by MermaidJS ([#1860](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/1860)).

Above two scripts are loaded only when there's at least one `mermaid` diagram.

Here's a sample diagram:

```
\```mermaid
---
title: Simple sample
---
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Still
\```
```

Here's how the above will look:
